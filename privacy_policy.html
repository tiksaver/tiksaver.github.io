    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Modified: Jul 24th, 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to TikSaver (the "App"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal information from you. The App does not require you to create an account, log in, or provide any personal data.</p>

    <h2>3. What Personal Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use our Services, we may also collect data automatically from you and/or your device which may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data and analytics about your use of our Services;</li>
        <li>Your IP address and mobile device identifiers (such as your device ID, advertising ID, MAC address, IMEI);</li>
        <li>Data about your device, such as device name and operating system, browser type and language;</li>
        <li>Data we collect with cookies and similar technologies;</li>
        <li>Data about your use of our Services, such as in-application interaction and usage metrics.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
    <p>We may use advertising networks and partners (such as AdMob) to serve ads in the App. These networks may collect and use your advertising ID for interest-based advertising purposes. Advertising IDs are non-permanent, non-personal identifiers that are uniquely associated with your device.</p>

    <h2>5. Media Storage</h2>
    <p>All media (videos, photos) saved using the App are stored locally on your device. We do not store or have access to any of your media files.</p>

    <h2>6. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for any content that you download or save using the App. You must ensure that you have the right to download and use any media, and you must not use the App for any unlawful or prohibited activities. Misuse of the App, including but not limited to, downloading or distributing copyrighted material without permission, is your responsibility.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites and services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any third-party services you interact with.</p>

    <h2>8. Information from Third-Party Sources</h2>
    <p>We may receive personal information about you from third-party sources. For example, if you clicked on an advertisement to direct you to one of our Services, we may be provided with information from which ad-network and advertising campaign the install originated. You may also choose to connect to our Services via your social media account. Exactly what information we receive from your social media will depend on your social media privacy settings, but it typically includes your basic public profile information such as your username, profile picture, age range, and gender.</p>

    <h2>9. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>Some of the information we collect may be collected using cookies and/or similar technologies (such as "SDKs" or software development kits). These technologies help us provide a better user experience by understanding user interactions with the App.</p>

    <h2>10. Do we transfer your personal information outside of the country you are resident?</h2>
    <p>Our Services are global by nature and your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country. We take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in our Privacy Policy. Adequate safeguards that our partners may use include standard contractual clauses approved by EU Commission and the Privacy Shield certification in case of transfers to the USA.</p>

    <h2>11. Age Limits</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about or direct or target interest-based advertising to anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services. If you are under 13, please do not send any data about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under the age of 13 should provide us any personal data. If we learn that we have collected personal data about a child under age 13, we will delete that data as soon as it is practicably possible.</p>

    <h2>12. Legal Action</h2>
    <p>We may disclose your personal data to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our customers, or others.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to amend or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and any changes will be published on our Services. The date of the most recent revision will appear on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. If you do not agree with any changes, please do not continue to use our Services.</p>
